                <p>I was born in Sierra Vista, AZ on October 23rd, 1983. As a native to southeast Arizona, the heat doesn't
                    bother me too much, and I have an affinity for burritos, raspados (when I can get my hands on them),
                    Eegee's, and other things that make this part of the country a truly unique to place to live.
                </p>
                <p>My goal with this bootcamp is to do a complete shift in career. Previously, I have worked in management at
                    The Melting Pot, Jimmy John's, and QuikTrip. After close to 12 years working holidays, weekends, and
                    anywhere from 50-70 hour work weeks, I wanted to do something for myself. My hope after six months in
                    bootcamp is to have a fresh start and have in demand skills.
                </p>
                <p>While I am not studying, I enjoy spending time with my family (three kids and my wife), trying different
                    types of beer, listening to music, and gaming (both tabletop and electronic).</p>
